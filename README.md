Hexlet's 1st project.

Just a set of simple games those are prompting you to provide an answer.

You need to answer correctly 3 times in a row to win.

## Installation:
1. `make install` - install dependencies
2. `make build` - build wheel
3. `make package-install` - install built wheel as executable package

## Run Games:
`make brain-even` - is number even (yes/no)?

`make brain-prime` - is number prime (yes/no)?

`make brain-calc` - provide an answer for a simple arithmetic operation.

`make brain-gcd` - provide the greatest common divisor.

`make brain-progression` - provide omitted element for a given progression.


If you run `make build` and `make package-install` then you can omit `make` and just run games because they are installed in your environment now.
